Maps allow you to implement business logic in the form of rules and to define input and output specifications.

## How to create a new map

1. create a new Extender project. 
2. Right Click on Map files, and create a new map.
3. In the outline view, right click on the map name you have created and create a new map.
4. Now, create input and output cards for the map created and select the type trees/Xsds and type as the structure to be referred in that card and also specify the input's source and output's target. 
5. Create the mapping rules in the rule pane corresponding to each output field.
6. You can simply drag the input field/group to the output field/group in case if its a one-to-one mapping.  
7. You can also write rules involving in-built functions adding logic to it.
8. Build and compile.

## file name extensions

1. Source map : .mms

2. compiled map : .mmc

3. Trace : .mtr

4. datapower map: .dpa

5. Type tree: .mtt

## Functional maps 

Functional maps are like sub-routines. You can write a generic logic in a functional map and call it in multiple places.
