IBM transformation extender(ITX) maps can be used in Sterling Integrator for data transformation using ITX map service component.

ITX map service component combines ITX data transformation capabilities with Sterling B2B integration capabilities.

You can either use it in Graphical Process Modeler (GPM) to configure a business process or you can edit Business Process Modeling Language (BPML) meta-language of a business process to configure the ITX Map service. 

Configure the map service settings to use the compiled map of ITX(`.mmc`).  Map can have multiple input and output cards. If the map don't receive input from SI then it will consider the map settings to take input from the configured adapters.
