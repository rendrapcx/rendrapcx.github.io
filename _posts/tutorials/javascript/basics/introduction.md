# Javascript Basics

## Sample HelloWorld program

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); // prints Hello, World! 
```
console.log is used to print the message to get displayed to the user.

## Statements and Semicolons
* The above line of code is called a statement. 
* Statements are seperated by semi-colon(;)
* Javascript doesn't throw error in absence of semi-colons if a line break is present between them. Javscript interprets line break as implicit semicolon.
* It's always a best practice to add semi-colon at the end of the statement.

## Comments

1. Single line comments

  `//` is used to comment a single line

2. Multi line comments

  `/**/` is used to comment multiple lines.

## Modern Mode

* You must explictly declare with directive `"use Strict"` or `'use Strict'` at the top of the script to tell the javascript should work in strict mode.
