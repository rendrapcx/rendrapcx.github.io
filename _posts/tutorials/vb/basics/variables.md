Variables are like containers which holds the data values. A variable specifies the name of the memory location. 

## How to declare variables

```vb
Dim VariableName As Datatype 'variable Declaration
VariableName = value 'Variable Initialization
```

## Naming convention of variables

* Variable names can have only letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore(`_`).
* Variables naming cannot contain white spaces like `first name` which is a invalid variable name.
* First letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore(`_`).
* It is always advisable to give some meaningful names to variables.

## Example

val = 100
