When ever you want to perform a set of operations based on a condition if and if-else are used.

## 1. If

```py
if conditional-expression :
    #code
```
### Example

```py
x = 10
y = 20

if (x != y) : 
  print (" x and y are not equal") 
```

## 2. If-else

```py
if conditional-expression :
    #code
else :
    #code
```
### Example

```py
x = 10
y = 10

if (x != y) : 
  print (" x and y are not equal")
else :
  print ("x and y are equal")
```

## 3. Nested If-else

```py
if conditional-expression :
    #code
elif conditional-expression :
    #code
else :
    #code
```

### Example

```py
x = 10
y = 20

if (x > y) :
  print (" x is greater than y")
elif (x < y ) :
  print ("x is less than y") 
else :
  print ("x and y are equal")
```
