Loops are used to perform iterations on a block of code based on a criteria.

Python provides `for` and `while` loops to loop over iterable-objects

## For

For loop is used to iterate over arrays(list, tuple, set, dictionary) or strings.

### Syntax
```py
for variable in arrays :
    #code
```

### example
```py
mylist=("Iphone","Pixel","Samsung")
for i in mylist:
    print(i)
```

## While

While is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. Usually while is preferred when number of ierations is not known in advance.

### Syntax

```py
while condition :  
    #code 
```

### Example

```py
i = 1
while(i<=10) :
  print (i)
  i += 1
```

Indentation is very important in Python, make sure the indentation is followed correctly
