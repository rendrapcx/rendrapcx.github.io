Functions is a sub-routine which contains set of statements. Usually functions are written when multiple calls are required to same set of statements which increases re-usuability and modularity. Function gets run only when it is called.

## How to define a Function

```py
def function_name(parameters):
    #code
```

## How to call a Function

```c
function_name (parameters)
```

## Example

```py
def greeting(name):
    print("Happy learning" + " " + name + "!")

greeting("foo")
```

Result of the above sample program is:

```
Happy learning foo!
```
