Collection is a group of objects which can be represented as a single unit. Collections are introduced to bring a unified common interface to all the objects.

Collection Framework was introduced since JDK 1.2 which is used to represent and manage Collections and it contains:

1. Interfaces
2. Classes
3. Algorithms

This framework also defines map interfaces and several classes in addition to Collections.

### Advantages:
* High performance
* Reduces developer's effort
* Unified architecture which has common methods for all objects.
