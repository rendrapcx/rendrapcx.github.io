## HTML Element

## HTML Tag

HTML tags are like hidden keywords which define how your web browser formats and display the data with in a web page.

Usually tags contains an opening and a closing part. For example, `<h1>` is the opening tag and `</h1>` is the closing tag. Both opening and closing tags must share same tag name. Never forget the closing tag as it may produce unexpected results if not provided.

There are some exceptions where tags may not have closing tag like `<img />`, <br/>. 

## HTML Attribute

HTML attributes allow you to provide additional information about the elements like you are customising a HTML tag, and are defined within the opening tag. In the below example `src` is an attribute to `<img>` tag.

```html
<img src="image.jpg"/>
```
