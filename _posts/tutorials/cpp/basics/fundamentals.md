## Sample C++ program

```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!!";
    return 0;
}  
```

**`#include <iostream>`** : iostream is a inbuilt header library which allows you to deal with input and output objects like cout etc.

**`using namespace std`** : The above line means that the object and variable names can be used from standard library.

**`cout`** : cout is used to print the output.

**`main()`** : main function is the entry point of any C++ program.

**`return 0`** : To end the main function
