# Introduction to network security

Lesson 7 of 9 

**At the core of the lesson, you will learn how to:** 

- Recognize the importance of network security
- List types of network security threats
- List techniques to mitigate network security threats

### What is network security?

Network security is a set of *guidelines and configurations* that are designed as preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure. Network security:  

- Is designed to preserve the *usability and integrity of a network, and the data that flows through the network.*
- Is concerned with protecting *a computer network and its resources* from *unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction*.
- Combines *policies and procedures* with *hardware and software solutions* to achieve this goal.

### The importance of network security

According to the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council), "Information collected and stored electronically by the organizations is sensitive, crucial, and private information. It most likely includes crucial business data, customers’ personal information, and other information that is valuable for business transactions. Unauthorized access to the network and its data creates a threat to security. Several statutory privacy requirements should be followed like HIPAA, FEPRA, and others to prevent the data from unauthorized dissemination. Failure to do so will leave you responsible for the consequences."

For more information, refer to the [How good is your Network Security?](https://www.eccouncil.org/network-security/) page on the EC-Council website.

### Network security threats

A security threat is any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal, or gain unauthorized access to an organization’s network to steal data or perform a malicious activity.

#### Example of network security threats

<details>
  <summary>Malware</summary>
  <markdown>
        Software that purposefully intends to damage a computer, client, server, or network. Ransomware, spyware, and viruses are all examples of malware.
    </markdown>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Social engineering</summary>
    <markdown>
        Using deception to trick a person into reveal personal or confidential information. A common example is phishing attacks that disguise themselves as requests for information from trusted service providers.
  </markdown>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Network attacks</summary>
  <markdown>
    Actions that seek to gain unauthorized access to a network to steal data or perform a malicious activity. A common example is the distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack, which creates many requests on a service. The service then becomes so overwhelmed that it becomes inaccessible to users or devices that might need it.

#### Examples of network security solutions

<details>
  <summary>Anti-Malware</summary>
  <markdown>
  Software that protects both the network and the devices on the network
  </markdown>

<details>
  <summary>Encryption</summary>
  <markdown>
    Scrambling data at rest or in transit to keep it private so that it can only be read by the intended recipient
  </markdown>
</details>

<details>  
  <summary>Firewall</summary>
  <markdown>
              A hardware or software solution that filters incoming and outgoing traffic in a network to prevent unauthorized access
  </markdown>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Intrusion detection system (IDS)</summary>
  <markdown>
        A hardware or software solution that monitors traffic in the network to detect intrusions, and generates alerts when they occur.
