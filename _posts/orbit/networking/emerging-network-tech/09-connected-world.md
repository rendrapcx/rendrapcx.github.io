# A connected world: Exploring emerging technologies

Lesson 9 of 9

**At the core of the lesson, you will learn how to:**

- List some new wireless technologies and their characteristics
- Define bring your own device (BYOD) and mobile device management (MDM)
- Identify the primary goal of the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Identify strategies and techniques for keeping current with emerging technologies  

### Wireless technologies

Wireless technologies are devices that communicate through the air.

- Wireless technology plays a key role in today’s communications.
- Emerging technologies—including robots, drones, self-driving vehicles, and new medical devices—all have a need for wireless technologies.

### Examples of emerging wireless technologies

- **Wireless Gigabit (WiGig)** was first announced in 2009 by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance.  WiGig was designed for fast speeds over short distances. You can take full advantage of a WiGig network if you have two or more devices on a WiGig network in the same room, with no obstacles between them. An example use case for WiGig is streaming content wirelessly from a device to a high-resolution TV.  
- **HaLow (pronounced *halo*)** was first announced in 2016. It is a low-power, long-range version of Wi-Fi. HaLow was designed and developed for small data payloads and low-power devices. It can extend Wi-Fi to 900 MHz. It works well for sensors and wearable technologies, and it has twice the range of current Wi-Fi.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** optimizes energy consumption. You might also hear Bluetooth Low Energy referred to as *BLE*, *Bluetooth LE*, or *Bluetooth Smart*. BLE technology is primarily used in mobile applications, and it is suitable for IoT. It was initially developed for the periodic transfer of small chunks of data over short ranges. BLE is used in solutions that span a range of domains, including healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment.
- **5G cellular systems** are a new technology that has been deployed throughout 2019 and 2020. The complete rollout of this technology will take a couple of years. It will eventually provide download speeds up to 10 Gbps.  

### What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to physical devices, or *things*, that are connected to the internet so they can share and collect data.  

The primary goal of IoT is to enable devices to self-report in real time, which can improve efficiency. It can also surface important information more quickly than a system that depends on human intervention.

Many devices are in homes, factories, oil wells, hospitals, cars, and other places that need to be connected. Data from these devices can be collected, stored, and analyzed to design better solutions or products. IoT devices include consumer applications (like thermostats) and commercial applications (such as industrial sensors, smart watches, and smart toasters). They also include devices in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), such as health monitors.

### Enterprise mobility

Enterprise mobility is a growing trend for businesses. This approach supports remote-working options, which use your personal laptops and mobile devices for business. Remote workers can connect and access data through cloud technology.

Two specific solutions enable enterprise mobility:  

- *Bring your own device (BYOD)* is the use of a personal device, like a mobile phone or tablet, on a public or private network. This solution includes the use of a personal device on a corporate network.
- *Mobile device management (MDM)* is a term that describes the management of mobile devices, though it also applies to laptop and desktop computers. Organizations use MDM solutions so that they can provide devices with settings, software, and access to data in a secure way that complies with their needs.  

### Staying current with emerging technologies

You have many options for keeping up-to-date with the latest technology trends that will impact the future of networking. Many websites, authors, professional networking groups, and other resources are devoted to covering the latest developments in networking. The following list of resources are specific to AWS, which you might find useful.
